## Building Multi-Chain

Migaloo is home of the RIDE Group. The RIDE group are a group of individual teams building dApps on Migaloo and throughout the Cosmos alongside the White Whale team. Being part of the RIDE group gives you and your team access to a hive mind of experienced builders dedicated to building across multiple chains.

## Learn more about the RIDE program:

### Overview
Operating on a single blockchain exposes projects to risks and limitations: 
- If the blockchain encounters issues, so does your application. 
- If the blockchain’s ecosystem loses momentum, your app follows suit. 
To create a more resilient system, having a presence on multiple chains within the Interchain is crucial. White Whale, the industry leader with its live Interchain Liquidity Protocol on nine Cosmos chains and counting, introduces the RIDE program to help projects ambitiously scale with us and unlock their full potential.

The White Whale team is the creator of the Migaloo blockchain, a permissionless CosmWasm blockchain with the latest technology in the Cosmos ecosystem. WHALE, the native token of the Migaloo chain, is the cornerstone of the Migaloo ecosystem, spearheaded by its flagship application, the White Whale Interchain Liquidity Protocol. Migaloo made a groundbreaking accomplishment as the first-ever blockchain to implement re-staking through use of the Alliance Module.

### Why Choose the RIDE Program?
Joining WhiteWhale's RIDE Program offers numerous benefits, allowing teams to seamlessly scale and diversify their operations and expand across multiple chains throughout the Cosmos. 

**Participants are able to:**

- Launch alongside White Whale’s satellite markets on all current and future smart contract platforms, ensuring a solid start in new markets.
