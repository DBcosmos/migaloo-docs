# SAIL Program

## Overview <a href="#id-5cae" id="id-5cae"></a>

Blockchain communities seek strategies to escalate their growth in an increasingly multi-chain world while ensuring sustainability and resilience. Inspired by the success of the RIDE Program, a new initiative called the White Whale SAIL Program is here to bridge the gap for blockchain ecosystems. The essence of the SAIL Program is to provide ecosystems with access to essential applications, communities, and liquidity to jumpstart their hyper-growth.

## Existing Challenges <a href="#e845" id="e845"></a>

New blockchain ecosystems often face several challenges, including creating a solid community, ensuring liquidity, and offering essential DeFi and NFT applications. Building and maintaining all these elements in-house can be resource-intensive and hinder competitive edge as the landscape evolves swiftly. Furthermore, attracting or contracting external teams to build these applications takes time and does not guarantee timely delivery or success. The SAIL Program, built on the foundation of the White Whale RIDE Program, offers blockchain communities a robust support system.
