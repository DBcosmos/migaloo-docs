# Migaloo Zone Tech

## **ReStaking** (**First** [**Alliance**](https://docs.alliance.money/) **Chain):**&#x20;

Migaloo was the first chain in the Cosmos to integrate the alliance module and enable the re-staking of assets. The Alliance Module allows chains to form economic Alliances. These alliances allow smaller chains to gain capital inflows from bigger chains and helps to diversify the staking rewards of smaller chains.\
The Alliance re-staking module also allows for ecosystem tokens to be staked to the chain, helping to bootstrap Migaloo dApps such as Ginkou (Money Market) and LP tokens from WhiteWhale increasing Liquidity.

## Home to the [WhiteWhale](https://app.whitewhale.money/migaloo/dashboard) Protocol:

WhiteWhale (WW) is an innovative interchain DEX which is Currently Live across various Cosmos chains. WW was the first DEX to launch on Osmosis (not including Osmosis itself) and paved the way forward in boosting Osmosis' potential to become a fully-fledged economic zone with multiple dApps powered by WW and the RIDE partners.

## Native Token Factory

The Token Factory allows you to create your own native denoms, as recognised by the Cosmos SDK Bank Module. This allows your protocol to issue its own token, without needing to support the CW20 standard. This sets a new and more secure way to build DeFi products

## [Skip MEV](https://skip.money/)

Skip enables sovereign blockchain protocols such as Migaloo Zone to supercharge their user experience, interoperability, and value capture with its vertically integrated product suite.

## IBC 7

An interchain bridge allowing safe transfer of assets across chains that have Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) enabled. Migaloo Zone always strives to use the latest IBC tech to allow its users and products to access the full security that IBC allows.

## [SDK46](https://docs.cosmos.network/)

The [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub, as well as permissioned Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchains. Blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK are generally referred to as **application-specific blockchains**.

## Packet Forwarding Middleware

The packet-forward-middleware module is an IBC middleware module built for Cosmos blockchains utilizing the IBC protocol allowing routing of incoming IBC packets from a source chain to a destination chain

## IBC Hooks

The IBC hooks module is an IBC middleware that enables ICS-20 token transfers to initiate contract calls. This functionality allows cross-chain contract calls that involve token movement. IBC hooks are useful for a variety of use cases, including cross-chain swaps, which are an extremely powerful primitive.
