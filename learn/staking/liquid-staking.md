# Liquid Staking

### What is Liquid Staking?

Liquid staking is a solution for locking up a user's tokens and contributing to the security of proof of stake blockchains. With liquid staking, users can stake on a PoS network without compromising their ability to transfer ownership of their staked tokens by generating a transferable liquid staking token (LST), which demonstrates ownership of staked tokens and any network rewards accrued to those tokens.

With traditional methods of staking, users coins are subject to bonding and unbonding period (21-days), liquid staking provides stakers with increased liquidity and capital efficiency. Token holders stake their tokens and receive a receipt token as evidence of their ownership of their staked token. The receipt token can be transferred, stored, traded, and utilized in DeFi or supported dapps.\

## WHALEx

WHALEx is an innovative liquid staking solution designed by leveraging the Alliance SDK module. WHALEx is a liquid staked version of WHALE/wBTC LP tokens staked to Migaloo. By liquid staking WHALE/wBTC LP tokens through WHALEx, users maximize their staking rewards, and contribute to protocol-owned liquidity (PoL) on Migaloo.

### How WHALEx Works

The Alliance module enables users to stake WHALE/wBTC LP tokens to the Migaloo blockchain, earning a portion of Migaloo’s inflation as staking rewards. However, standard LP staking involves a take rate — a percentage of staked LP tokens distributed to WHALE stakers, the community pool, and validators.

By liquid staking with WHALEx, users retain their LP position through while their staking rewards are automatically used to generate more LP tokens, which are then staked again. This compounding mechanism enhances liquidity and increases TVL without requiring users to manage their staking positions manually.

## Utility

Our liquid staking tokens are unique with the fact they have utility across various Cosmos chains. WHALE LSTs can be bonded to the WhiteWhale DEX in order to earn a portion of WHALE buybacks. The buybacks are powered by the volume of the DEX on that particular chain. Higher volume, higher rewards. \
Users aer also incentivised to bond for longer periods of time. When users bond they are able to build up a "multiplier" on there rewards, meaning loyal bonders earn a greater and greater percentage of the buybacks as long as they don't unbond there WHALE LSTs.\


### BackBone Labs

BackBone Labs are pioneers in the NFTFi space, enabling yield-bearing NFTs to thrive across the Cosmos by using their LSTs across various chains to bootstrap NFT yield and LST liquidity.
