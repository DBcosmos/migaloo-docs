# Gauge System

## What is a Guage Voting system?

A gauge voting mechanism is a decentralized system used for allocating resources or rewards within a blockchain ecosystem; 7.5% of Migaloo Zone inflation in the case of ReStake DAO. It allows $RSTK stakers to influence inflation rewards based on the amount of tokens they hold and their preferences.

In short $RSTK stakers are able to vote for the assets they want to recieve Migaloo Zone inflation. The more votes an asset has the more of Migaloo's inflation it recieves.

## What assets can be listed and how can they be listed?

{% endhint %}

Any token or coin (including LP tokens) can be listed on $RSTK DAO. In order for an asset to be listed to ReStake DAO and start receiving Migaloo Zone inflation a gavernane proposal has to pass (click [here](https://daodao.zone/dao/migaloo1pxuqr7je9h7slchdsgz5ufc3kklrevyfnxmq0dkjru5k6e6mdm2sw23hfz/proposals/A21) to see example of a WhiteListing prop).

When Whitelisting an asset add it to the [Cosmos Chain Registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/migaloo/assetlist.json) (Migaloo).

## How do I vote?

To take part in guage voting first ensure you have $RSTK staked to the [DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/migaloo1pxuqr7je9h7slchdsgz5ufc3kklrevyfnxmq0dkjru5k6e6mdm2sw23hfz/home). Once you have staked $RSTK and have voting power you can use [Eris Protpcol's](https://www.erisprotocol.com/migaloo/restake-gauges) gauge voting page to vote for the assets you want to direct Migaloo's inflation towards

## Minimum Votes required

In order to receive Migaloo inflation assets must maintain a minimum voting power of 1%. If an assets votes fall below 1% it recieves zero Migaloo inflation and is at risk of being delisted as a whiteiested asset.

## How do I stake WhiteListed Assets?

Assets are stakable via the [Migaloo Zone](https://app.migaloo.zone/) front end under teh "Retaking" tab. 

{% hint style="success" %}
In order for Migaloo Zone's front end to calculate the assets staking APR it must have pool on WhiteWhale DEX or a Coin Gecko ID
