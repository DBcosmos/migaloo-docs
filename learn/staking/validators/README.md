# Validators

## What is a Validator?

The role of validators is to run a full node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by the validator's private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive revenue from inflation and transaction fees in exchange for their work securing the chain and processing transactions. Validators must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.

## What is a full node?[â€‹](https://hub.cosmos.network/validators/validator-faq#what-is-a-full-node) <a href="#what-is-a-full-node" id="what-is-a-full-node"></a>

A full node is a server running a chain's _binary_ (its software) that fully validates transactions and blocks of a blockchain and keeps a full record of all historical activity. A full node is distinct from a pruned node that processes only block headers and a small subset of transactions. Running a full node requires more resources than a pruned node. Validators can decide to run either a full node or a pruned node, but they need to make sure they retain enough blocks to be able to validate new blocks.\
It is possible and encouraged for users to run full nodes even if they do not plan to be validators.&#x20;

## Validator Analytics

Validators can be analysed based on various performance metrics such as uptime, server location, voting habits and more. Here are some useful tools to analyse validators.
