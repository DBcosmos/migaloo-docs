# Choose a Validator

## How to choose a validator

Delegators are free to choose validators according to their own subjective criteria. Selection criteria includes:

* **Amount of validator-bonded WHALE:** Number of WHALE a validator has delegated to themselves. A validator with a higher amount of self-delegated WHALE indicates that the validator is sharing the risk and consequences for their actions.
* **Amount of delegated WHALE:** Total number of WHALE delegated to a validator. A high voting power shows that the community trusts this validator. Larger validators also decrease the decentralization of the network, so delegators are suggested to consider delegating to smaller validators to increase decentralisation.
* **Commission rate:** Commission applied on revenue by validators before the revenue is distributed to their delegators.
* **Track record:** Delegators can review the track record of the validators they plan to delegate to. This track record includes past votes on proposals and historical average uptime.
* **Community contributions:** Another (more subjective) criteria is the work that validators have contributed to the community, such as educational content, participation in the community channels, contributions to open-source software, etc.

## What is Validator Commission?

Revenue received by a validator's pool is split between the validator and their delegators. The validator can apply a commission on the part of the revenue that goes to their delegators. This commission is set as a percentage. Each validator is free to set their initial commission, maximum daily commission change rate, and maximum commission. The commission rate itself can be changed after the validator is created.

The community is expected to behave in a smart and self-preserving way. When a mining pool in Bitcoin gets too much mining power the community usually stops contributing to that pool. Migaloo Zone relies on the same effect. Additionally, when delegators switch to another validator, they are not subject to the unbonding period, which removes any barrier to quickly redelegating tokens in service of improving decentralisation.
