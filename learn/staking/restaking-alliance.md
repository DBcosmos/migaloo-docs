# Alliance

Migaloo Zone is leading the way with its unique and innovative use of ReStaking made possible by the Cosmos SDK "[Alliance Module](https://docs.alliance.money/)". Migaloo has adapted and evolved the Alliance Module to suit its own unique needs. Initially, the Alliance module was designed for two sovereign blockchains to bootstrap each other's staking rewards for bigger chains to support smaller chains by supplementing the smaller chains staking rewards with more well-established, more liquid and less volatile assets and in reverse the bigger chain can diversify its staking rewards and reward its stakers with a wider variety of assets.\
Migaloo has leveraged the Alliance module to allow not only the ReStaking of other L1 coins but also Ecosystem tokens, and LP Tokens and has also democratised the process of listing new Tokens and how much inflation they receive by launching "[ReStake DAO](restake-dao/)"

## What is Alliance?

> Alliance is an [open-source Cosmos SDK module](https://github.com/terra-money/alliance) that leverages interchain staking to form economic alliances among blockchains. General information on the Alliance module can be found in the [Overview](https://docs.alliance.money/overview) and [How it works](https://docs.alliance.money/alliance) sections. Visit the [Integration guide](https://docs.alliance.money/guides/get-started) to learn how to add Alliance to your chain. For detailed information on Alliance, visit the [in-depth concepts section](https://docs.alliance.money/concepts/staking) or the [Technical specs](https://docs.alliance.money/tech/parameters).

Migaloo Alliance assets are decided by governance proposals. Any IBC assets can be listed via this process assuming the the voters (Validators and Stakers) agree to the proposal. The proposals to list an Alliance asset should provide information such as the Token Denom, "Take Rate" and "Reward Rate". See examples: [#1](https://dashboard.station.money/proposal/migaloo-1/23), [#2](https://dashboard.station.money/proposal/migaloo-1/28), [#3](https://dashboard.station.money/proposal/phoenix-1/4802).

## PoL

Liquidity is a key part of any DeFi ecosystem, that's why Migaloo Zone has chosen to adopt the unique strategy of allowing WHALE / wBTC liquidity pool tokens (LPs) to be staked to the chain and earn a portion of Migaloo's staking rewards. This tactic bolsters the liquidity of the chain's flagship application, WhiteWhale (WW).

## WHALEx

WHALEx is a liquid staking derivative of staked WHALE/wBTC LP tokens. This token auto-compounds allowing users to maximise reward efficiency and create a positive feedback loop for WHALE liquidity.

### Take Rate

Stakers of WHALE/wBTC are subject to a take rate of 50%. The take rate is an annualized "tax" applied to a particular Alliance assets, in the case WHALE/wBTC LP tokens. The take rate is redistributed to all stakers meaning $WHALE stakers, as well as validators also earn the LP token. On top of this the community pool also earns WHALE/wBTC LP tokens, gradually building protocol owned liquidity.
