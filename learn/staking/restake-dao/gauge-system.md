# Gauge System

## What is a Gauge Voting System?

A gauge voting mechanism is a decentralized system used for allocating resources or rewards within a blockchain ecosystem; 7.5% of Migaloo Zone inflation in the case of ReStake DAO. It allows $RSTK stakers to influence inflation rewards based on the number of tokens they hold and their preferences.

In short $RSTK stakers are able to vote for the assets they want to receive Migaloo Zone inflation. The more votes an asset has the more of Migaloo's inflation it receives.

## What assets can be listed and how can they be listed?

To get assets added to the frontend ASAP here is a how-to: https://github.com/White-Whale-Defi-Platform/alliance-staking?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-add-your-token-for-restaking
{% endhint %}

Any token or coin (including LP tokens) can be listed on $RSTK DAO. In order for an asset to be listed to ReStake DAO and start receiving Migaloo Zone inflation a governance proposal has to pass (click [here](https://daodao.zone/dao/migaloo1pxuqr7je9h7slchdsgz5ufc3kklrevyfnxmq0dkjru5k6e6mdm2sw23hfz/proposals/A21) to see an example of a WhiteListing prop).

When Whitelisting an asset add it to the [Cosmos Chain Registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/migaloo/assetlist.json) (Migaloo).

## How do I vote?

To take part in gauge voting first ensure you have $RSTK staked to the [DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/migaloo1pxuqr7je9h7slchdsgz5ufc3kklrevyfnxmq0dkjru5k6e6mdm2sw23hfz/home). Once you have staked $RSTK and have voting power you can use [Eris Protocol's](https://www.erisprotocol.com/migaloo/restake-gauges) gauge voting page to vote for the assets you want to direct Migaloo's inflation towards

## Minimum Votes required

In order to receive Migaloo inflation assets must maintain a minimum voting power of 1%. If an asset's votes fall below 1% it receives zero Migaloo inflation and is at risk of being delisted as a whitelisted asset.

## How do I stake WhiteListed Assets?

Assets are stakable via the [Migaloo Zone](https://app.migaloo.zone/) front end under the "Retaking" tab.

{% hint style="success" %}
In order for Migaloo Zone's front end to calculate the assets staking APR it must have a liquidity pool on WhiteWhale DEX or a Coin Gecko ID
